Beginner Level: Boston House Price Prediction

Project Overview:
This project focuses on predicting house prices using Machine Learning regression techniques. 
The Boston Housing dataset is used to build a model that estimates house prices based on various input features.

Objectives:
Understand the basic Machine Learning workflow
Perform data preprocessing and cleaning
Train and evaluate a regression model
Save the trained model
Deploy the model using a web application
Dataset: Boston Housing Dataset
Contains features such as crime rate, number of rooms, tax rate, and accessibility

Tools and Technologies:
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Streamlit
Joblib

Methodology:
Loaded and explored the dataset
Handled missing values
Selected relevant features
Split data into training and testing sets
Scaled numerical features
Trained a regression model
Evaluated model performance
Saved the trained model
Developed a web application for prediction

Outcome:
A functional house price prediction system demonstrating basic Machine Learning concepts and deployment.
