Beginner Level: Boston House Price Prediction

Project Overview: This project focuses on predicting house prices using Machine Learning regression techniques. The Boston Housing dataset is used to build a model that estimates house prices based on various input features.

Objectives: Understand the basic Machine Learning workflow Perform data preprocessing and cleaning Train and evaluate a regression model Save the trained model Deploy the model using a web application Dataset: Boston Housing Dataset Contains features such as crime rate, number of rooms, tax rate, and accessibility

Tools and Technologies: Python Pandas NumPy Scikit-learn Streamlit Joblib

Methodology: Loaded and explored the dataset Handled missing values Selected relevant features Split data into training and testing sets Scaled numerical features Trained a regression model Evaluated model performance Saved the trained model Developed a web application for prediction

Outcome: A functional house price prediction system demonstrating basic Machine Learning concepts and deployment.


Intermediate Level: Loan Approval Prediction System

Project Overview:
This project aims to predict loan approval status using classification techniques. 
The model is trained on historical loan application data to classify whether a loan is likely to be approved or rejected.


Objectives:
Perform advanced data preprocessing
Analyze and encode categorical features
Train and compare classification models
Evaluate model performance
Build and deploy a prediction system

Dataset:
Loan Prediction Dataset
Includes applicant income, co-applicant income, loan amount, credit history, education, and property area

Tools and Technologies:
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Streamlit
Joblib

Methodology:
Loaded and analyzed the dataset
Handled missing values using median and mode
Encoded categorical variables
Removed irrelevant columns
Split data into training and testing sets
Applied feature scaling using StandardScaler
Trained a Random Forest classifier
Evaluated model using accuracy and classification report
Saved the trained model and scaler
Developed a Streamlit web application

Outcome:
A deployed loan approval prediction system that classifies applications based on applicant and loan-related features.
