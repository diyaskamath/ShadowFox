Project Overview:
This project aims to predict loan approval status using classification techniques. 
The model is trained on historical loan application data to classify whether a loan is likely to be approved or rejected.

Objectives:
Perform advanced data preprocessing
Analyze and encode categorical features
Train and compare classification models
Evaluate model performance
Build and deploy a prediction system

Dataset:
Loan Prediction Dataset
Includes applicant income, co-applicant income, loan amount, credit history, education, and property area

Tools and Technologies:
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Streamlit
Joblib

Methodology:
Loaded and analyzed the dataset
Handled missing values using median and mode
Encoded categorical variables
Removed irrelevant columns
Split data into training and testing sets
Applied feature scaling using StandardScaler
Trained a Random Forest classifier
Evaluated model using accuracy and classification report
Saved the trained model and scaler
Developed a Streamlit web application

Outcome:
A deployed loan approval prediction system that classifies applications based on applicant and loan-related features.
